# Brief.me Guidelines
Guidelines used in Brief.me private and public projects. This document aims at :
* Improving consistency intra- and inter-projects.
* Taking tangible decisions.
* Having a reference document to refer to.
* Helping new developers working on our projects.

Those guidelines are constantly evolving and are the results of discussions 
from Brief.me's tech team and outside collaborators.
